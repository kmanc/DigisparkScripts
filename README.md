Some scripts to go with the [digispark board](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Digispark-Kickstarter-ATTINY85-Arduino-General-Micro-USB-Development-Board-/142062832671?hash=item21139acc1f:g:2RUAAOSwAL9UdypA).  Download the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and use it to upload the script to your digispark board.  Then just plug it in and watch the sript execute!
